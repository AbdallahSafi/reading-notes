# Domain Modeling

The process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.

## Define a constructor and initialize properties

To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function.

```javascript
var EpicFailVideo = function (epicRating, hasAnimals) {
  this.epicRating = epicRating;
  this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
};

var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
var corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4, true);
```

This is object-oriented programming in JavaScript at its most fundamental level.

- The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
- The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
- The object is stored in a variable for later use.

# HTML Tables

The HTML tables allow to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables.

The HTML tables are created using the `<table>` tag in which the `<tr>` tag is used to create table rows and `<td>` tag is used to create data cells. The elements under `<td>` are regular and left aligned by default

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Table Heading

Table heading can be defined using `<th>` tag.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Salary</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ramesh Raman</td>
    <td>5000</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Shabbir Hussein</td>
    <td>7000</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Cell padding and Cell spacing Attributes

There are two attributes called cellpadding and cellspacing which you will use to adjust the white space in your table cells. The cellspacing attribute defines space between table cells, while cellpadding represents the distance between cell borders and the content within a cell.

````html
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Salary</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ramesh Raman</td>
    <td>5000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Shabbir Hussein</td>
    <td>7000</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
````

## Colspan and Rowspan Attributes

You will use colspan attribute if you want to merge two or more columns into a single column. Similar way you will use rowspan if you want to merge two or more rows.

```html
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
    <th>Column 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Row 1 Cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 1 Cell 2</td>
    <td>Row 1 Cell 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2 Cell 2</td>
    <td>Row 2 Cell 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">Row 3 Cell 1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Table Header, Body, and Footer

The three elements for separating the head, body, and foot of a table are −

- `<thead>` − to create a separate table header.

- `<tbody>` − to indicate the main body of the table.

- `<tfoot>` − to create a separate table footer.

````html
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="4">This is the head of the table</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="4">This is the foot of the table</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
      <td>Cell 3</td>
      <td>Cell 4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
````

# Functions, Methods, and Objects”

## Creating a JavaScript Object

Using the JavaScript Keyword new:

```javascript
var person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
```

### Updating an object

```javascript
var person = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue" };

var x = person;
x.age = 10; // This will change both x.age and person.age
delete person lastname // this will delete the person lastname proberty
```

### Creatin many objects with constructor

```javascript
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta
console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe
```

### What is this?

The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

It has different values depending on where it is used:

- In a method, this refers to the owner object.
- Alone, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
- In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
- Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.

### Arrays are objects

Objects are an unordered map from string keys to values, arrays are an ordered list of values (with integer keys). That's the main difference. They're both non-primitive, as they're composed of multiple values, which also implies pass-by-reference in JavaScript.

Arrays are also a kind of object, though, so you can attach extra properties to them, access their prototype and so on.

In your revised example, you're only taking advantage of the fact that an array is actually an object, i.e. you can set any property on them. You shouldn't do that. If you don't need an ordered list of values, use a plain object.

### Browser object model

The Browser Object Model (BOM) is used to interact with the browser.

The default object of browser is window means you can call all the functions of window by specifying window or directly.

| Method       | Description                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| alert()      | displays the alert box containing message with ok button.                               |
| confirm()    | displays the confirm dialog box containing message with ok and cancel button.           |
| prompt()     | displays a dialog box to get input from the user.                                       |
| open()       | opens the new window.                                                                   |
| close()      | closes the current window.                                                              |
| setTimeout() | performs action after specified time like calling function, evaluating expressions etc. |

Example:

```javascript
//Example of alert() in javascript
function msg() {
  alert("Hello Alert Box");
}

//Example of confirm() in javascript
function msg() {
  var v = confirm("Are u sure?");
  if (v == true) {
    alert("ok");
  } else {
    alert("cancel");
  }
}
```

# Document object model

JavaScript can access all the elements in a webpage making use of Document Object Model (DOM). In fact, the web browser creates a DOM of the webpage when the page is loaded. The DOM model is created as a tree of objects like this:

![image](https://www.guru99.com/images/JavaScript/javascript8_1.png)

- Changing HTML Elements:

## Global object

In JavaScript, there's always a global object defined. In a web browser, when scripts create global variables, they're created as members of the global object.

###  Strings Object

The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.

As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.

`var val = new String(string);`

Date objects are created with new Date().

There are four ways of instantiating a date

```javascript
var d = new Date();
var d = new Date(milliseconds);
var d = new Date(dateString);
var d = new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);
```
