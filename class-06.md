# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming

As the title says the most hard thing about programming not the programming language or the technologies but understanding the problem that you are trying to solve.

If you introduce a familiar problem domain to group of coders they will have no issue developing the product that solve the problem.

**Why problem domains are hard?**

Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.

**What can you do about it?**

1. Make the problem domain easier

You can make the problem easier to understand if you cut down it to little problems that you can understand. and you focus in one of them each time. After solving one problem you go to the other till you finish solving all the little pieces.

2. Get better at understanding the problem domain.

You should make sure to understand the problem from the customer by asking the right questions.
