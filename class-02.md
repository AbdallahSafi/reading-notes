# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## Structural markup
The elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

### Headings
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
`<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

```
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

### Paragraphs
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

`<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

### Bold & Italic
 **Bold**

 The HTML `<b>` element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

 `<b>This text is bold</b>`

 *Italic*

 The HTML `<i>` element defines italic text, without any extra importance.

`<i>This text is italic</i>`

### Subscript & Superscript

The `<sub>` tag defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line.

The `<sup>` tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line.

### Line break & Horizontal Rules

The `<br>` tag inserts a single line break.

The `<hr>` element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.

## Semantic Markup

### Strong & Emphasis

The `<strong>` tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in **bold**.

The `<em>` tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in *italic*.

### Quotations

The  `<blockquote>` tag indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.

The `<q>` tag defines a short quotation.

### Abbreviations & Acronyms

The `<abbr>` tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".

### Citation & Definitions

The `<cite>` tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

The `<dfn>` tag stands for the "definition element", and it specifies a term that is going to be defined within the content.

### Auther Details

The `<address>` tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.


### Changes to content

The `<ins>` tag defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text.

The `<del>` tag defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text.

The `<s>` tag specifies text that is no longer correct, accurate or relevant. The text will be displayed with a line through it.

## Introducing CSS

Css works by associating rules with Html elements. These rules specify how the element should be displayed.
a Css rule conatins to parts, selector and a decleration.
