##  How the web works ?

Letâ€™s start with the most obvious way of using the internet: You visit a website like google.com.
The moment you enter this address in your browser and you hit ENTER, a lot of different things happen:

1. The URL gets resolved
2. Contact the (DNS) servers
3. Obtain the IP address associated with the requested domain name.
4. A Request is sent to the server of the website
5. The response of the server is parsed
6. The page is rendered and displayed
